This is a quick and dirty library for converting between currencies
using the foreign exchange information posted daily at:
http://www.ecb.int/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/index.en.html

The library is so simple that it is easier for a user to just read the
documentation strings and the function definitions themselves, so
please look at simple-currency.lisp if you want more detailed
documentation.

Usage:

First call

(cies:update-currencies-hash)

If it does not return NIL, you are ready to go

example:

(cies:convert 100 :usd :gbp)

==> 
10775/167
#<SIMPLE-DATE:INTERVAL P1D>

You have to do any coercion and rounding yourself.
