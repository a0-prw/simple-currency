This is a quick and dirty library for converting between currencies
using the foreign exchange information posted daily by the ECB. You
can find more information on the time of updates etc at:

http://www.ecb.int/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/index.en.html

The library is so simple that it is easier for a user to just read the
documentation strings and the function definitions themselves, so
please look at simple-currency.lisp if you want more detailed
documentation.

Usage:

(ql:quickload :simple-currency)
(cies:update-currencies-hash)

If it does not return NIL, you are ready to go

example:

(cies:convert 100 :usd :gbp)

==> 
861350/13373
#<SIMPLE-DATE:INTERVAL P1D>

If you want it to look like a money amount, you have to do any
coercion and rounding yourself:

(cies:display-currency (cies:convert 100 :usd :gbp) :gbp)

==>
"GBP 64.41"

 likewise checking the interval for
unacceptably old quotations - see documentation for simple-date.

Remember that floats "contaminate" so if you do 

(cies:convert 100.25 :eur :usd)

You will get a float back.
