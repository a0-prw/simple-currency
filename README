This is a simple library for converting between currencies
using the foreign exchange information posted daily by the ECB. You
can find more information on the time of updates etc at:

http://www.ecb.int/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/index.en.html

The library is so simple that it is easier for a user to just read the
documentation strings and the function definitions themselves, so
please look at simple-currency.lisp if you want more detailed
documentation.

Installation:

This package uses DRAKMA, XMLS, SIMPLE-DATE, SPLIT-SEQUENCE, and
CL-STORE but if you use quicklisp (http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/),
they will be automatically installed for you.  Put this package
somewhere quicklisp can find it, by default under
~/quicklisp/local-projects/.  Then do the following 2 things:

(ql:quickload :simple-currency)
(CIES:UPDATE-CURRENCIES-HASH) ;;downloads currency info from ecb

If it does not return NIL, you are ready to go

Usage example:

(CIES:CONVERT 100 :USD :GBP)

==> 
861350/13373
#<SIMPLE-DATE:INTERVAL P1D>

If you want it to look like a money amount, you can do

(CIES:DISPLAY-CURRENCY (CIES:CONVERT 100 :USD :GBP) :GBP)

==>
"GBP 64.41"

Likewise with checking the interval for unacceptably old quotations -
see documentation for simple-date.

NB: Remember that floats "contaminate" so if you do (CIES:CONVERT
100.25 :eur :usd).  You will get a float back: display-currency calls
a function which expects a rational, so that will signal an error.

Convenience facilities:

There is a macro (CIES:WITH-CURRENCY :xyz <conversion-form>) which can
replace references to (convert <number> <target currency>) in
conversion-form with (DISPLAY-CURRENCY (CONVERT <number> <from> <to>)
<from>).  I haven't thought very hard about this macro, so it might
hold unintended surprises.

There is a simple database of currency information which can be
accessed with CIES:LOOKUP-CURRENCY, so for example, if you are in the
SIMPLE-CURRENCY package or have USED it:

(ccy-ddigits (lookup-currency :jpy))
==>
"0"

Another example:

(map 'list (lambda (acode)
                   (let ((cd (lookup-currency acode)))
                     (list acode (ccy-country cd) (ccy-name cd))))
           (available-currencies))
